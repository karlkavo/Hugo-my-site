Here's a list of some of the fun projects I have done in the past:

* Simple HTML & CSS [restaurant website](https://html-css-resterauntdemo.netlify.app/)
* Python [word game](http://karlkavo.pythonanywhere.com/), try to make as many three-letter words from a random source word.
* A very basic [Freight Management](https://github.com/karlkavo/Java-Freight-Managment) application written in Java with a JavaFX GUI
* A fun [Starwars soundboard](https://star-wars-soundboard-js.netlify.app/) using HTML, CSS & JavaScript
* Relax and unwind, with my HTML, CSS & Javascript [Meditation](https://js-calm-relax-meditate.netlify.app/) app
* [Boards](http://red5jedi.pythonanywhere.com/) app written in Python and the Django framework
* Another soundboard using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, this time its a [Drum Kit.](https://jsdrumkit00001.netlify.app/)
* Creepy [Halloween theme](https://musing-knuth-ada0cf.netlify.app/) (animated clouds and stars) using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

This is just a few of the projects I have worked on, over the next few days I will be adding much more!
