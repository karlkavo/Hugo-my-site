Here's a list of some of the fun projects I have done in the past:

* Simple HTML & CSS [restaurant website ](https://html-css-resterauntdemo.netlify.app/)
* A fun [Starwars soundboard](https://star-wars-soundboard-js.netlify.app/) using HTML, CSS & JavaScript
* HTML, CSS & Javascript [Meditation](https://js-calm-relax-meditate.netlify.app/) app
* Another soundboard using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, this time its a [Drum Kit.](https://jsdrumkit00001.netlify.app/)

This is just a few of the projects I have worked on, over the next few days I will be adding much more!
