If you don't already have Visual Studio Code installed, go to the VS Code [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) page where you can find platform-specific setup instructions for [macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac), [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux), and [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows).
