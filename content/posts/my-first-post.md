This site was created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted for FREE on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I'm also using [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) as a CMS. 

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is one of the most popular open-sourced static site generators, it's very powerful, flexible and has thousands of themes to choose from.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) makes it super easy for developers to host websites responsibly, in a way that is scalable and secure. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) simplifies the process for developers to deploy and host a website. It does all the work for them that they probably don't want to spend too much time or effort on. Not just that, but it also provides several benefits for editors too!

 [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) is a Git-backed CMS (content management system) for websites and web products built using [**_static site generators_**](https://forestry.io/docs/faqs/glossary/static-site-generators/ "Static Site Generators"). Forestry bridges the gap between developers and their teams, by making development fun and easy while providing powerful content management for their teams.
