VSCode is one of the best code editors out there at the moment. The reason itâ€™s so popular is simply that VSCode provides every developerâ€™s wants, including features that they didnâ€™t even know they needed.

**Here's a quick list of 5 of my favourite VS Code extensions that just make my development life easier!**

[Liver Server](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server): Liver Server lets you launch a local server with live reload for static and dynamic pages. Super useful extension, no more starting a server every time you make changes to your code.

[Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer): This extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colours. The user can define which characters to match, and which colours to use. This is really useful when you are working on a lot of code with lots of brackets.

[Prettier - Code Fotmatter](): is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. This is a great extension, it cleans up your code according to its default settings or your predefined settings.
