**Here's a quick list of 5 of my favourite VS Code extensions that just make my development life easier!**

1. [Liver Server](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server): Liver Server lets you launch a local server with live reload for static and dynamic pages.

2. [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer): This extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colours. The user can define which characters to match, and which colours to use. This is really useful when you are working on a lot of code with lots of brackets.
