I am a Junior Software Engineer mostly involved in Web Development. I am currently working for [ServisBOT](https://servisbot.com/), where I am part of the Bot-Building/Customer Sucess team.  
In my day to day Bot Building I get to play aroud with cool technologies like:

- [Google DialogFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogflow)
- [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/)
- [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?blog-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&blog-cards.sort-order=desc)
- [Twilio](https://ahoy.twilio.com/twilio-products?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=twilio&utm_campaign=G_S_Brand_EMEA_UK&IRE_mCPC=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI35Ppq_a66gIVGLLtCh36-gbiEAAYASAAEgKdw_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

I am a graduate of the Institute of Technology, Carlow where I studied Software Development, I have also studied Computer Science at Griffith College, Dublin and recently I completed a level 8 certificate in Data Protection.  
I am very interested in [Conversation Design](https://designguidelines.withgoogle.com/conversation/conversation-design/what-is-conversation-design.html#:~:text=Conversation%20design%20is%20a%20design,based%20on%20pen%20and%20paper.&text=It's%20a%20synthesis%20of%20several,audio%20design%2C%20and%20UX%20writing.) (_Conversation design is a design language based on human conversation)_ UI & UX. I like how applications and websites look and function.

### Hobbies

In my spare time I like to keep fit, I am currently studying Jujitsu, I am also 2nd Degree Blackbelt in Tae Kwon-Do and I like to play the guitar (badly). I play golf in the real worl and play a lot of games online.  
I have been interested in computers since the age of 13. I got a Sincalir Spectrum for Christmas and I've been hooked ever since!
