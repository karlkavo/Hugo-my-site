I'm a graduate of the Institute of Technology Carlow, where I studied Software Development and I have also studied Computer Science at Griffith College Dublin.

I'm a  Software Engineer mostly involved in Web Development and customer success. Technology is a passion of mine and I enjoy nothing more than learning the trends that technology is taking in order to work more efficiently and see progress and success. I love seeing the big picture mapped out for technology needs. Whether it's cloud services or the future needs of a departmentâ€™s wireless technology. Efficiency is huge to me, and I have a passion for finding new and more productive ways to reach goals. Mapping out the technological solutions for the future is an important way to ensure efficiency is reached in every process possible.
