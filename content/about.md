I'm a  Software Engineer mostly involved in Web Development. I'm a graduate of the Institute of Technology Carlow, where I studied Software Development. I have also studied Computer Science at Griffith College Dublin. I am currently undertaking a Digital media course with IT Carlow.

### Hobbies

In my spare time, I like to keep fit. I am also a 2nd Degree Black belt in Tae Kwon-Do. I like to play the guitar (badly). I play golf (also badly) and game online.  
I've been interested in computers and technology from an early age, when I was 13 I got a Sinclair Spectrum and I've been hooked ever since!
