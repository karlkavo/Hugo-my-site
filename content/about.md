I'm a  Software Engineer mostly involved in Web Development. I'm a graduate of the Institute of Technology Carlow, where I studied Software Development and I have also studied Computer Science at Griffith College Dublin.

I am interested in UX & UI and providing an all-round user/customer experience.
