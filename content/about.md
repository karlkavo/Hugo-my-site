I'm a Junior Software Engineer mostly involved in Web Development. I am currently working for [ServisBOT](https://servisbot.com/), where I am part of the Bot-Building/Customer Sucess team.  
In my day to day Bot Building role, I get to play around with cool technologies like:

* [Google DialogFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogflow)
* [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/)
* [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?blog-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&blog-cards.sort-order=desc)
* [Twilio](https://ahoy.twilio.com/twilio-products?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=twilio&utm_campaign=G_S_Brand_EMEA_UK&IRE_mCPC=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI35Ppq_a66gIVGLLtCh36-gbiEAAYASAAEgKdw_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

I'm a graduate of the Institute of Technology, Carlow where I studied Software Development, I have also studied Computer Science at Griffith College, Dublin and recently I completed a level 8 certificate in Data Protection.

### Hobbies

In my spare time, I like to keep fit. I am currently studying Jujitsu, and I am also a 2nd Degree Black belt in Tae Kwon-Do. I like to play the guitar (badly). I play golf (also badly) in the real world and play a lot of games online.  
I've been interested in computers and technology from an early age, when I was 13 I got a Sinclair Spectrum and I've been hooked ever since!
